Did Data Analysis of Datasets regarding credit card payments

Credit Card Defaulters Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms
---
Here, i trained my Model to predict weather the customer will default his next month credit card paymrnt or not.
- Did Data Preprocessing followed by EDA
- Since the data was huge, so scaled down for better accuracy.
- Used XGBoost Classifier with the help of Randomized search CV and Hyperparameter tuning.
- And by cross validation score, was able to find out the adequate accuracy for the model.
