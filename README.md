# CreditCard data analysis
Did Data Analysis of Datasets regarding credit card payments

## Credit Card Defaulters Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Here, i trained my Model to predict weather the customer will default his next month credit card paymrnt or not.
- Did Data Preprocessing followed by EDA.
- Since the data was huge, so scaled down for better accuracy.
- Used XGBoost Classifier with the help of Randomized search CV and Hyperparameter tuning.
- And by cross validation score, was able to find out the adequate accuracy for the model.



## Detecting Fraud in Credit card transactions using Machine Learning Algorithms

#### In this, my trained model was able to detect the fraud which was done in the transaction.
- Using Data Analysis, done some Visualizations.
- Data preprocessing was required.
- Founded correlation by plotting a Heatmap.
- Trained my model using Support Vector Machine Algorithm (SVM)
- And was able to get adequate prediction scores.
